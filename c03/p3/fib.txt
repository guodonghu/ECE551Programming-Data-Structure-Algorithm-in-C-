step1: 5th Fibonacci number is 5;
step2: 0th Fibonacci number is 0;
       1th Fibonacci number is 1;
       2nd Fibonacci number is 0+1=1;
       3rd Fibonacci number is 1+1=2;
       4th Fibonacci number is 1+2=3;
       5th Fibonacci number is 2+3=5;
step3: 
       test if (N<0) if it is true then return 0;
       else if N==0 || N==1 return n;
       else  name a variable as sum;
       sum = N-1th Fibonacci number + N-2th Fibonacci number, for each N-1th and N-2th Fibonacci number, go to the beginning of s       tep3(recursion);
       return sum;
       }
step4: N=6, 6th Fibonacci number = 8;
