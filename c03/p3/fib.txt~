step1: 5th Fibonacci number is 5
step2: 0th Fibonacci number is 0
       1th Fibonacci number is 1
       2nd Fibonacci number is 0+1=1
       3rd Fibonacci number is 1+1=2
       4th Fibonacci number is 1+2=3
       5th Fibonacci number is 2+3=5
step3: 
       assign 0th Fibonacci number with 0;  1st Fibonacci number = 1;
       test if(N is larger than 1) {
       0th Fibonacci=0, 1st Fibonacci=1
       count from 2 to N(both inclusive), call it i {
       ith Fibonacci number = i-1th Fibonacci number + i-2th Fibonacci number
      }
       return ith Fibonacci number
       }
      else if(N==1 && N==1 ) {
        return FibonacciN;
      } 
      else return 0;    
step4: N=6, 6th Fibonacci number = 8;
